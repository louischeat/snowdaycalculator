"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, you can use the snow day predictor to predict snow days for private schools. While it primarily uses data from public school districts, its forecasts are based on local weather conditions, which can apply to any school in the area. You just need to enter your zip code.

"text": "Think of updates as the heartbeat of the system, ensuring accuracy and reliability. You�ll find the snow day predictor updates its data multiple times a day, aligning with the latest reports from the National Weather Service. This precision means you can trust it to keep you informed, helping you feel connected and prepared within your community.

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "You�d think a snow day predictor is complex enough, but no, the tool doesn�t account for early dismissals or late starts. It�s all about full-day closures. With precise data from local forecasts, it calculates probabilities based on historical trends. While you seek community in shared weather woes, remember, this tool is your go-to for snow day predictions, not the finer nuances of school scheduling. It�s precise, but not omniscient."
